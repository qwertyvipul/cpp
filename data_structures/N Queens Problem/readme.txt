1. User gives the number of queens
2. Instance of class NQueen is created and n is intialized
3. level of the class is currently 0

4. solving algorithm starts with creating n nodes for level 0
5. each node has a value (0-(n-1)) associated with it
6. A linked list for each node




create N node that points towards N-1 nodes which points towards N-2 nodes and so on till only one node is left to be pointed
